- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrianJosephThompson
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Ruby and Java and Rust someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, after getting familiar with JavaScript and C. I would say I am most proficient in Ruby at the moment.
- 💞️ I'm always looking for a new way to grow and learn, and am open to collaboration on anything, whether I understand it or not. I can learn :)
- 📫 How to reach me ... via email at brianjosephthompson1@gmail.com
